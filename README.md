# Android Rating Library Tester
## Rate your app
If you're an Android developer, you probably already ask your users to rate your app.

Users that love your app will give you high ratings. This leads to more installs.

When working on apps previously, I wrote custom code for this rating logic.

I was curious to see what libraries existed so that I didn't have to rewrite this code for each app.

## Tell us what you think
This is a tester app to let you try a few popular and recently updated rating libraries.
If you love a different library, open an issue and I'd like to implement it.
If you have any other feature requests or ideas for this app, also let us know.

There are lots of features I can add. First wanted to hear what is most important for you.

Make sure to follow [Google's Ratings/Reviews guidelines](https://play.google.com/about/storelisting-promotional/ratings-reviews-installs/) if you do ask users to rate your app.

## TODO
- Ask the community feedback on libraries, features, and ideas for this project.
- Add a full feature comparison chart (ease of setup, supported configurations, documentation quality, size, github stars, last commit date, styling support, programmatic support, dialogs vs views, callbacks, application lifecycle tracking).
- Hide/show configuration options for each library.
- Comparison between Android and iOS rating libraries.
