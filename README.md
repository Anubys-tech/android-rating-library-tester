# Android Rating Library Tester
## Rate your app
If you're an Android developer, you likely ask your users to rate your app.

Users that love your app will give you high ratings. This leads to more installs.

While working on apps previously, I wrote custom rating logic code.

With this app, you can experiment with different rating libraries to avoid re-writing this code.

## Give us feedback
If you love a different library or have feature requests or other ideas, open an issue.

Currently the libraries are minimally configured.

First wanted to hear what is most important from you before adding more features.

Make sure to follow [Google's Ratings/Reviews guidelines](https://play.google.com/about/storelisting-promotional/ratings-reviews-installs/) when you ask users to rate your app.

## TODO
- Add a full feature comparison chart (ease of setup, supported configurations, documentation quality, size, github stars, last commit date, styling support, programmatic support, dialogs vs views, callbacks, application lifecycle tracking).
- Hide/show configuration options for each library.
- Comparison between Android and iOS rating libraries.
