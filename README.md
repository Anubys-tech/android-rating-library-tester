# Android Rating Library Tester
## Rate your app
If you're an Android developer, you probably prompt your users to rate your app.

Users that love your app will give you high ratings. This leads to more installs.

While developing apps, I usually write custom rating prompt code.

With this app, you can experiment with different rating libraries to avoid re-writing this type of code.

## What else would be helpful?
If you love a different library, have a feature request, or other ideas, open an issue.

Currently the libraries are minimally configured.

I first want to hear what would be helpful to you before adding more features.

Make sure to follow [Google's Ratings/Reviews guidelines](https://play.google.com/about/storelisting-promotional/ratings-reviews-installs/) when you prompt users to rate your app.

Development of this test app is live streamed on [GitDuck](https://gitduck.com/sgallese).

## TODO
- Add a full feature comparison chart (ease of setup, supported configurations, documentation quality, size, github stars, last commit date, styling support, programmatic support, dialogs vs views, callbacks, application lifecycle tracking).
- Hide/show configuration options for each library.
- Comparison between Android and iOS rating libraries.
